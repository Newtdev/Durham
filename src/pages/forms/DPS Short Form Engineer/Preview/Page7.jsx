							Engineer also acknowledges that G.S. § 14-208.18 prohibits anyone
							required to register as a sex offender under Article 27A of
							Chapter 14 of the General Statutes from knowingly being on the
							premises of any school. Engineer shall conduct or arrange to have
							conducted, at its own expense, sexual offender registry checks on
							each of its owners, employees, agents and subcontractors
							(“contractual personnel”) who will engage in any service on or
							delivery of goods to School System property or at a School System
							sponsored event, except checks shall not be required for
							individuals who are solely delivering or picking up equipment,
							materials, or supplies at: (1) the administrative office or
							loading dock of a school; (2) non-school sites; (3) schools closed
							for renovation; or (4) school construction sites. The checks shall
							include at a minimum checks of the State Sex Offender and Public
							Protection Registration Program, the State Sexually Violent
							Predator Registration Program, and the National Sex Offender
							Registry (“the Registries”). For Engineer’s convenience only, all
							of the required registry checks may be completed at no cost by
							accessing the United States Department of Justice Sex Offender
							Public Website at <i>http://www.nsopw.gov/.</i> Engineer shall
							provide certification on the Owner’s Sexual Offender Registry
							Check Certification Form (Exhibit C) that the registry checks were
							conducted on each of its contractual personnel providing services
							or delivering goods under this Agreement prior to the commencement
							of such services or the delivery of such goods. Engineer shall
							conduct a current initial check of the registries (a check done
							more than 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement shall not
							satisfy this contractual obligation). In addition, Engineer agrees
							to conduct the registry checks and provide a supplemental
							certification form before any additional contractual personnel are
							used to deliver goods or provide services pursuant to this
							Agreement. Engineer further agrees to conduct annual registry
							checks of all contractual personnel and provide annual
							certifications at each anniversary date of this Agreement.
							Engineer shall not assign any individual to deliver goods or
							provide services pursuant to this Agreement if said individual
							appears on any of the listed registries. Engineer agrees that it
							will maintain all records and documents necessary to demonstrate
							that it has conducted a thorough check of the registries as to
							each contractual personnel, and agrees to provide such records and
							documents to the School System upon request. Engineer specifically
							acknowledges that the School System retains the right to audit
							these records to ensure compliance with this section at any time
							in the School System’s sole discretion. Failure to comply with the
							terms of this provision shall be deemed a material breach of the
							Agreement. In addition, the School System may conduct additional
							criminal records checks at the School System’s expense. If the
							School System exercises this right to conduct additional criminal
							records checks, Engineer agrees to provide within seven (7) days
							of request the full name, date of birth, state of residency for
							the past ten years, and any additional information requested by
							the School System for all contractual personnel who may deliver
							goods or perform services under this Agreement. Engineer further
							agrees that it has an ongoing obligation to provide the School
							System with the name of any new contractual personnel who may
							deliver goods or provide services under the Agreement. The School
							System reserves the right to prohibit any contractual personnel of
							Engineer from delivering goods or providing services under this
							Agreement if the School System determines, in its sole discretion,
							that such contractual personnel may pose a threat to the safety or
							well-being of students, school personnel or others.
