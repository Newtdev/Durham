							required registry checks may be completed at no cost by accessing
							the United States Department of Justice Sex Offender Public
							Website at no cost by accessing the United States Department of
							Justice Sex Offender Public Website at http://www.nsopw.gov/.
							Contractor shall provide certification on the Sexual Offender
							Registry Check Certification Form that the registry checks were
							conducted on each of its contractual personnel providing services
							or delivering goods under this Agreement prior to the commencement
							of such services or the delivery of such goods. Contractor shall
							conduct a current initial check of the registries (a check done
							more than 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement shall not
							satisfy this contractual obligation). In addition, Contractor
							agrees to conduct the registry checks and provide a supplemental
							certification form before any additional contractual personnel are
							used to deliver goods or provide services pursuant to this
							Agreement. Contractor further agrees to conduct annual registry
							checks of all contractual personnel and provide annual
							certifications at each anniversary date of this Agreement.
							Contractor shall not assign any individual to deliver goods or
							provide services pursuant to this Agreement if said individual
							appears on any of the listed registries. Contractor agrees that it
							will maintain all records and documents necessary to demonstrate
							that it has conducted a thorough check of the registries as to
							each contractual personnel, and agrees to provide such records and
							documents to DPS upon request. Contractor specifically
							acknowledges that DPS retains the right to audit these records to
							ensure compliance with this section at any time in DPS’s sole
							discretion. Failure to comply with the terms of this provision
							shall be deemed a material breach of the Agreement. In addition,
							DPS may conduct additional criminal records checks at DPS’s
							expense. If DPS exercises this right to conduct additional
							criminal records checks, Contractor agrees to provide within seven
							(7) days of request the full name, date of birth, state of
							residency for the past ten years, and any additional information
							requested by DPS for all contractual personnel who may deliver
							goods or perform services under this Agreement. Contractor further
							agrees that it has an ongoing obligation to provide DPS with the
							name of any new contractual personnel who may deliver goods or
							provide services under the Agreement. DPS reserves the right to
							prohibit any contractual personnel of Contractor from delivering
							goods or providing services under this Agreement if DPS
							determines, in its sole discretion, that such contractual
							personnel may pose a threat to the safety or well-being of
							students, school personnel or others.
