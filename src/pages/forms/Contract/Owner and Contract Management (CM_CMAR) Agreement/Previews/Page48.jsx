          CM shall conduct a current initial check of the registries (a check
          done more than 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement shall not
          satisfy this contractual obligation). &nbsp;In addition, CM agrees to
          conduct the registry checks and provide a supplemental certification
          form before any additional contractual personnel are used to deliver
          goods or provide services pursuant to this Agreement. &nbsp;CM further

          Agreement. &nbsp;CM shall not assign any individual to deliver goods
          or provide services pursuant to this Agreement if said individual
          appears on any of the listed registries. &nbsp;CM agrees that it will
          maintain all records and documents necessary to demonstrate that it
          has conducted a thorough check of the registries as to each
          contractual personnel, and agrees to provide such records and
          documents to the Owner upon request. &nbsp;CM specifically
          acknowledges that the Owner retains the right to audit these records
          to ensure compliance with this section at any time in the
          Owner&rsquo;s sole discretion. &nbsp;Failure to comply with the terms
          of this provision shall be deemed a material breach of the agreement.
          &nbsp;In addition, the Owner may conduct additional criminal records
          checks at the school system&rsquo;s expense. &nbsp;If the Owner
          exercises this right to conduct additional criminal records checks, CM
          agrees to provide within seven (7) days of request the full name, date
          of birth, state of residency for the past ten years, and any
          additional information requested by the Owner for all contractual
          personnel who may deliver goods or perform services under this
          Agreement. &nbsp;CM further agrees that it has an ongoing obligation
          to provide the Owner with the name of any new contractual personnel
          who may deliver goods or provide services under the Agreement.
          &nbsp;Owner reserves the right to prohibit any contractual personnel
          of CM from delivering goods or providing services under this Agreement
          if Owner determines, in its sole discretion, that such contractual
          personnel may pose a threat to the safety or well-being of students,
          school personnel or others.
