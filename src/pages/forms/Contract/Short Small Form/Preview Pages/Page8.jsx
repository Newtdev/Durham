						subcontractors (of any tier) will remain in compliance with these

						providing affordable health care coverage to all of its full-time

						Lunsford Act/Criminal Background Checks. The Design Consultant also
						acknowledges that G.S. § 14-208.18 prohibits anyone required to
						register as a sex offender under Article 27A of Chapter 14 of the
						General Statutes from knowingly being on the premises of any school.
						The Design Consultant shall conduct or arrange to have conducted at
						its own expense sexual offender registry checks on each of its
						employees, agents, ownership personnel, or contractors (“contractual
						personnel”) who will engage in any service on or delivery of goods
						to school system property or at a school-system sponsored event,
						except checks shall not be required for individuals who are solely
						delivering or picking up equipment, materials, or supplies at: (1)
						the administrative office or loading dock of a school; (2)
						non-school sites; (3) schools closed for renovation; or (4) school
						construction sites. The checks shall include at a minimum checks of
						the State Sex Offender and Public Protection Registration Program,
						the State Sexually Violent Predator Registration Program, and the
						National Sex Offender Registry (“the Registries”). For the Design
						Consultant’s convenience only, all of the required registry checks
						may be completed at no cost by accessing the United States
						Department of Justice Sex Offender Public Website at{" "}
						<span className="text-blue-500">http://www.nsopw.gov/</span>. The
						Design Consultant shall provide certification on the Sexual Offender
						Registry Check Certification Form that the registry checks were
						conducted on each of its contractual personnel providing services or
						delivering goods under this Agreement prior to the commencement of
						such services or the delivery of such goods. The Design Consultant
						shall conduct a current initial check of the registries (a check
						done more than 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement shall not
						satisfy this contractual obligation). In addition, the Design
						Consultant agrees to conduct the registry checks and provide a
						supplemental certification form before any additional contractual
						personnel are used to deliver goods or provide services pursuant to
						this Agreement. The Design Consultant further agrees to conduct
						annual registry checks of all contractual personnel and provide
						annual certifications at each anniversary date of this Agreement.
						The Design Consultant shall not assign any individual to deliver
						goods or provide services pursuant to this Agreement if said
						individual appears on any of the listed registries. The Design
						Consultant agrees that it will maintain all records and documents
						necessary to demonstrate that it has conducted a thorough check of
						the registries as to each contractual personnel, and agrees to
						provide such records and documents to the Owner upon request. The
						Design Consultant specifically acknowledges that the Owner retains
						the right to audit these records to ensure compliance with this
						section at any time in the Owner’s sole discretion. Failure to
						comply with the terms of this provision shall be deemed a material
						breach of the Agreement. In addition, the Owner may conduct
						additional criminal records checks at the Owner’s expense. If the
						Owner exercises this right to conduct additional criminal records
						checks, the Design Consultant agrees to provide within seven (7)
						days of request the full name, date of birth, state of residency for
						the past ten years, and any additional information requested by the
						Owner for all contractual personnel who may deliver goods or perform
						services under this Agreement. The Design Consultant further agrees
						that it has an ongoing obligation to provide the Owner with the name
						of any new contractual personnel who may deliver goods or provide
						services under the Agreement. The Owner reserves the right to
						prohibit any contractual personnel of the Design Consultant from
						delivering goods or providing services under this Agreement if the
						Owner determines, in its sole discretion, that such contractual
						personnel may pose a threat to the safety or well-being of students,
						school personnel or others.
