              prohibits anyone required to register as a sex offender under
              Article 27A of Chapter 14 of the General Statutes from knowingly
              being on the premises of any school. &nbsp;Engineer shall conduct
              or arrange to have conducted, at its own expense, sexual offender
              registry checks on each of its owners, employees, agents and
              subcontractors (&ldquo;contractual personnel&rdquo;) who will
              engage in any service on or delivery of goods to School System
              property or at a School System sponsored event, except checks
              shall not be required for individuals who are solely delivering or
              picking up equipment, materials, or supplies at: (1) the
              administrative office or loading dock of a school; (2) non-school
              sites; (3) schools closed for renovation; or (4) school

              Program, the State Sexually Violent Predator Registration Program,
              and the National Sex Offender Registry (&ldquo;the
              Registries&rdquo;). &nbsp;For Engineer&rsquo;s convenience only,
              all of the required registry checks may be completed at no cost by

              Sexual Offender Registry Check Certification Form (Exhibit C) that
              the registry checks were conducted on each of its contractual
              personnel providing services or delivering goods under this
              Agreement prior to the commencement of such services or the
              delivery of such goods. &nbsp;Engineer shall conduct a current
              initial check of the registries (a check done more than 30 days
              prior to the date of this Agreement shall not satisfy this
              contractual obligation). &nbsp;In addition, Engineer agrees to
              conduct the registry checks and provide a supplemental
              certification form before any additional contractual personnel are
              used to deliver goods or provide services pursuant to this
              Agreement. &nbsp;Engineer further agrees to conduct annual
              registry checks of all contractual personnel and provide annual
              certifications at each anniversary date of this Agreement.
              &nbsp;Engineer shall not assign any individual to deliver goods or
              provide services pursuant to this Agreement if said individual
              appears on any of the listed registries. &nbsp;Engineer agrees
              that it will maintain all records and documents necessary to
              demonstrate that it has conducted a thorough check of the
              registries as to each contractual personnel, and agrees to provide
              such records and documents to the School System upon request.
              &nbsp;Engineer specifically acknowledges that the School System
              retains the right to audit these records to ensure compliance with
              this section at any time in the School System&rsquo;s sole
              discretion. &nbsp;Failure to comply with the terms of this
              provision shall be deemed a material breach of the Agreement.
              &nbsp;In addition, the School System may conduct additional
              criminal records checks at the School System&rsquo;s expense.
              &nbsp;If the School System exercises this right to conduct
              additional criminal records checks, Engineer agrees to provide
              within seven (7) days of request the full name, date of birth,
              state of residency for the past ten years, and any additional
              information requested by the School System for all contractual
              personnel who may deliver goods or perform services under this
              Agreement. &nbsp;Engineer further agrees that it has an ongoing
              obligation to provide the School System with the name of any new
              contractual personnel who may deliver goods or provide services
              under the Agreement. &nbsp;The School System reserves the right to
              prohibit any contractual personnel of Engineer from delivering
              goods or providing services under this Agreement if the School
              System determines, in its sole discretion, that such contractual
              personnel may pose a threat to the safety or well-being of
              students, school personnel or others.
