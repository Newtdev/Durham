            The CM understands, confirms and agrees that its responsibility
            hereunder is to construct the Project in accordance with the
            drawings and specifications. &nbsp;It is recognized that the
            Guaranteed Maximum Price may be determined based upon incomplete
            design documents and in those instances in which the drawings and
            specifications are not complete at the time the Guaranteed Maximum
            Price is established, the CM shall exercise reasonable care and
            judgment to determine the intent of the design and shall calculate
            the Guaranteed Maximum Price on the basis of the quality of
            construction, materials, and finishes that can be reasonably
            inferred from the design documents or other specified sources.
            &nbsp;The CM shall determine unit prices and the cost of the Project
            and shall make those assumptions regarding the Project scope and the
            quality of the intended construction as may be necessary to fully
            document the Guaranteed Maximum Price. &nbsp;The Owner and CM shall
            use the most recently approved Project scope in determining whether
            or not the scope of the Project or a part thereof has been changed
            and in determining entitlement to an adjustment to the Guaranteed
            Maximum Price. &nbsp;A determination regarding all requests for
            adjustment to the Guaranteed Maximum Price shall be made in writing
            within thirty (30) days from the date of a written request for an
            adjustment.
