          Consultant, the CM shall inspect the work in order to ensure
          compliance with the contract documents, review the payment
          applications submitted by each contractor and determine whether the
          amount requested reflects the progress of the Contractor&rsquo;s Work.
          &nbsp;The CM shall make appropriate adjustments to each payment
          application and shall prepare and forward to the Owner a progress
          payment report. &nbsp;The report shall state the total contract price,
          payments to date, current payment requested, retainage and actual
          amounts owed for the current period. &nbsp;Included in this report
          shall be a certificate of payment that shall be signed by the CM and
          delivered to the Owner. &nbsp;The CM shall make payments that are due
          to all contractors, suppliers, and material men within ten (10) days
          following the receipt of payment for the work from the Owner. &nbsp;In
          addition, the CM shall keep the Project and the site on which Work is
          performed free and clear of all liens from Contractors,
          subcontractors, or suppliers. &nbsp;The CM shall provide sales tax
          information using the form attached as Appendix C with each payment
          application.

          not incorporated in the work but delivered and suitably stored at the
          site or in a bonded warehouse by the CM or contactor.&nbsp; Payments
          for materials or equipment stored shall only be considered upon
          submission by the CM of satisfactory evidence (for example, releases
          or paid invoices from the seller) that the CM or the contractor has
          acquired title to such material, that it will be utilized on the work
          under this contract and that it is satisfactorily stored, protected,
          and insured or that other procedures satisfactory to the Owner that
          will protect the Owner&#39;s interests have been taken.&nbsp; In the
          event the materials are stored in a bonded warehouse that is not
          located in the county of the Project, the CM shall reimburse the
          travel cost and hourly billing expenses incurred by the Design
          Consultant for travel to view and assess whether the materials meet
          the requirements of the contract documents. &nbsp;Materials once paid
          for by the Owner become the property of the Owner and may not be
          removed from the work site or bonded warehouse, other than to be
          delivered from the warehouse to the site, without the Owner&#39;s
          written permission. &nbsp;Responsibility for such stored materials and
          equipment shall remain with the CM and the contractor regardless of
          Ownership.
