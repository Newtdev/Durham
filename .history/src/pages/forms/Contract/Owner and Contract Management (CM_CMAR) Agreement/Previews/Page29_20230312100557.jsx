            claim under this section, he must, within ten (10) days after the
            furnishing of a written notice as outlined above, submit to the
            Owner a written statement setting forth the specific nature and
            anticipated cost of such claim, unless this period is extended by
            the Owner. &nbsp;The statement of claim hereunder may be included in
            the notice required above. &nbsp;The statement of claim shall
            include all direct, indirect and impact costs associated with the
            change, as well as the CM&#39;s estimate of the schedule impact of
            the change, if any. &nbsp;The CM and the contractors shall not be
            entitled to reimbursement or an increase in the GMP for any claims
            that are not filed in strict conformance with this section.
            &nbsp;The CM shall indemnify and hold the Owner harmless against any
            claims by the contractors that are waived because they are not filed
            in strict conformance with this section.

            any amount for indirect costs, damages or expenses of any nature,
            including, but not limited to, so-called &quot;impact&quot; costs,
            labor inefficiency, wage, material or other escalations beyond the
            prices upon which the proposal is based and to which the parties
            have agreed pursuant to the provisions of this section, and which
            the CM, the contractors or any other person may incur as a result of
            delays, interferences, suspensions, changes in sequence or the like,
            for whatever cause, whether reasonable or unreasonable, foreseeable
            or unforeseeable, or avoidable or unavoidable, arising from the
            performance of any and all changes in the work performed pursuant to
            this section, unless the delay is caused solely by the Owner or
            Design Consultant. &nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the
            CM&#39;s and the contractors&rsquo; sole and exclusive remedy in
            such event shall be recovery of direct costs as compensable
            hereunder and an extension of the contract time, but only in
            accordance with the provisions of the contract documents. &nbsp; No
            claim by the CM hereunder shall be allowed if asserted after final
            payment for the construction or the Project under this Agreement.
            &nbsp;No claim relating to or flowing from a particular change shall
            be allowed after execution of the change order relating to that
            change or commencement of the change by the CM, except as
            specifically provided in this section.

            GMP or an expansion or contraction in the contract time as a result
            of a change in the work, the CM shall not suspend performance of a
            change in the work or the work itself unless otherwise so ordered by
            the Owner in writing. &nbsp;The Owner shall, however, pay to the CM
            up to the Owner&#39;s reasonable estimated value of the change in
            the work, regardless of the dispute, if said change in the work
            results in an increase in the contract sum; and the Owner shall have
            the right to decrease the contract sum up to the Owner&#39;s
            reasonable estimated value of the change in the work, regardless of
            the dispute, if said change in the work results in a decrease in the
            contract sum. &nbsp;The CM&rsquo;s acceptance of payment following a
            unilateral decision by the Owner shall not constitute a waiver of
            any claim the CM may have for additional compensation or time.
            &nbsp;However, any claim the CM may have shall be filed in strict
            conformance with the contract documents.

            the proposal relating to labor, whether by the CM&#39;s forces or
            the forces of any of the contractors, shall include reasonably

            deleted from the contract (for such time as they would have been so

            unemployment insurance taxes and fringe benefits required by
            collective bargaining Agreements entered into by the contractor or

            subcontractor, as applicable (said overhead and profit to include

            percentage stated in section 7.4.1.
