            5.2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;The portion of the proposal relating to
            materials shall include the reasonably anticipated direct costs
            which would have been incurred by the contractor or to any
            subcontractors for materials which would have been purchased or
            incorporation in the work but which has been deleted from the
            contract, plus transportation and applicable sales and use taxes
            which will be avoided, and seven percent (7%) of said direct
            material costs incurred by the contractor or subcontractor
            (excluding transportation and sales and use taxes) as overhead and
            profit not incurred or earned &nbsp;by the contractor or any
            subcontractor (said overhead and profit to include all small tools),
            and shall &nbsp;further include the contractor&#39;s and
            subcontractor&#39;s reasonably anticipated rental costs which will
            be avoided (either actual or discounted local published rates), plus
            five percent (5%) thereof as overhead and profit not incurred or
            earned by the contractor or subcontractor, as applicable. &nbsp;If
            any of the items included in the lump sum proposal are covered by
            unit prices contained in the contract documents, the Owner may elect
            to use these unit prices in determining the amount of reduction to
            the GMP as a result of a deletion of work from the contract.
            &nbsp;No overhead and profit shall be applied to any unit prices for
            purposes of calculation such reduction in the contract sum.
            &nbsp;The lump sum proposal for work which would have been performed
            by any subcontractors shall include four percent (4%) of that amount
            as an estimate of the contractor&rsquo;s overhead and profit that
            will not be earned by contractor due to the decrease in the contract
            sum. &nbsp;In the event the construction work would have been
            performed by the CM in the limited circumstances allowed in this
            contract, the fee percentages stated in this section shall apply to
            the work that would have been performed by the CM as the contractor
            and its subcontractors.

            effort to agree as to the amount of such decrease, which may be
            based on a lump sum properly itemized, on unit prices stated in the
            contract documents and/or on such other basis as the parties may
            mutually determine. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to so agree, the
            amount of such decrease shall be the total of the estimated
            reduction in actual cost of the work, as determined by the Owner in
            its reasonable judgment, plus overhead and profit as stated above
            the CM&rsquo;s acceptance of payment following a unilateral decision
