          10.4.1.1&nbsp;After receipt of a notice of termination, the CM shall
          submit to the Owner his termination claim, in the form and with
          certification prescribed by the Owner. &nbsp;Such claim shall be
          submitted promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days from
          the effective date of termination, unless one or more extensions in
          writing are granted by the Owner upon request of the CM made in
          writing within such thirty (30) day period or authorized extension
          thereof. &nbsp;However, if the Owner determines that the facts justify
          such action, he may receive and evaluate any such termination claim at
          any time after such thirty (30) day period or any extension thereof.
          &nbsp;Upon failure of the CM to submit his termination claim within
          the time allowed, the Owner may determine, on the basis of information
          available to him, the amount, if any, due to the CM by reason of the
          termination.
