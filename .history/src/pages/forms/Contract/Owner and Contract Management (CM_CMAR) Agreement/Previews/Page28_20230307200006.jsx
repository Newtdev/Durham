          by the forces of any of the contractors, at actual cost to the entity
          performing the change in the work. &nbsp;The change proposal form
          attached as Appendix D-2 shall be used to submit the initial change
          proposal to the Owner for approval to proceed. &nbsp;The CM shall
          maintain records to submit to the Owner such as daily time and
          material tickets, to include the identification number assigned to the
          change in the work, the location and description of the change in the
          work, the classification of labor employed (and names and employee
          numbers), the materials used, the equipment rented (not tools) and
          such other evidence of cost as the Owner may require. &nbsp;The Owner
          may require authentication of all time and material tickets and
          invoices by persons designated by the Owner for such purpose.
          &nbsp;The failure of the CM to secure any required authentication
          shall, if the Owner elects to treat it as such, constitute a waiver by
          the CM of any claim for the cost of that portion of the change in the
          work covered by a non-authenticated ticket or invoice; provided,
          however, that the authentication of any such ticket or invoice by the
          Owner shall not constitute an acknowledgment by the Owner that the
          items thereon were reasonably required for the change in the work.
