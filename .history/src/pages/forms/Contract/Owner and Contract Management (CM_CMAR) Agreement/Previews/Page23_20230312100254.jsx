            it shall furnish such justification and supporting evidence as the

            contract, and shall further outline the alleged impact on the
            schedule&rsquo;s critical path. &nbsp;The burden of proof to
            substantiate a claim shall rest with the CM, including evidence that
            the cause was beyond its control. &nbsp;The Owner shall base its
            findings of fact and decision on such justification and supporting
            evidence, including a finding that the alleged delay impacted the
            Project&rsquo;s critical path, and shall advise the CM in writing

            extension of the contract time, the Owner&rsquo;s determination of
            the total number of days extension shall be based upon the currently
            approved progress schedule and on all data relevant to the
            extension. Such data will be incorporated into the schedule in the
            form of a revision thereto, accomplished in a timely manner.
            &nbsp;The CM acknowledges and agrees that actual delays (due to said
            changes, suspension of work or excusable delays) in activities
            which, according to the schedule, do not affect the contract time,
            do not have any effect upon the contract time and therefore will not
            be the basis for a change therein. The CM acknowledges and agrees
            that time extensions will be granted only to the extent that
            excusable delays exceed the available float in the critical path
            activities in the currently approved schedule.
