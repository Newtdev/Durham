            construction contingency may be used by the CM to expedite the work,
            address scheduling and coordination problems, respond to a default
            by a non-bonded contractor, and repair damaged work in place where
            the responsible contractor cannot be identified by the CM after

            the CM during the performance of its obligations pursuant to
            Paragraphs 3.3.1.5 and 3.3.1.6, correct scope gaps in the bidding of

            identified in change orders or request for information arising on
            previous uses of the same prototype design, and any issues that are
            the fault of the CM. &nbsp;The CM&rsquo;s use of the CM&rsquo;s
            construction contingency fund shall be documented in writing by the
            CM and approved by the Owner in writing prior to the CM billing for
            the work. The CM shall not be entitled to receive any fee for the
            use of the CM&rsquo;s contingency. &nbsp;In the event of a default
            by a contractor, the CM shall not use the CM&rsquo;s contingency to
            cover any costs covered by a performance or payment bond provided by
            the contractor or covered by a program paid for by the CM to insure
            the performance of the contractors. &nbsp;The CM shall vigorously
            pursue reimbursement of all expenses from the contractor&rsquo;s
            surety or through the program provided by the CM.
