          Design Consultant, contractors and subcontractors from loss or damage
          to work or property in the course of construction, including all

          final payment has been made or until no person or entity other than
          the Owner has an insurable interest in the property to be covered by
          this insurance, whichever is sooner. &nbsp;This insurance shall be in
          the form of &quot;builder&rsquo;s risk&quot; policy insuring
          &ldquo;risks of direct physical loss except those as specifically
          excluded by the policy&rdquo;, or equivalent. &nbsp;The policy shall

          debris removal, flood, water damage, earthquake, earth movement,
          testing, architect&rsquo;s and engineering fees, mechanical or
          electrical breakdown, collapse however caused, and/or damage resulting
          from defective design, workmanship or material. &nbsp;Limits shall be
          written for the value of the GMP and insure the full cost of
          replacement at the time of loss. &nbsp;Sub-limits for flood or
          earthquake are subject to approval by Owner. &nbsp;The CM shall cause
          such policy or policies of insurance required under this subparagraph
          to be endorsed so as to provide that the insurer or insurers waive any
          right of subrogation against the Owner. &nbsp;Notwithstanding any
          deductible provision, the CM shall remain solely liable for the full
          replacement cost of any item covered by such insurance, including any
          applicable deductible or co-insurance penalty. &nbsp; Prior to
          commencement of work, CM shall provide to Owner a copy of the
          builder&rsquo;s risk policy obtained in compliance with Section 8.2.1.
