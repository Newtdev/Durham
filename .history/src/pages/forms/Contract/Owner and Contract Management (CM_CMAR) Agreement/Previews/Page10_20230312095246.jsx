            a safe and secure condition and that the disturbed area is cleaned
            of any debris resulting from the access. &nbsp;In the event that the
            bidders&rsquo; access disturbs any adjacent property, including
            depositing dirt, soil or debris on the roads adjacent to the site,
            the CM shall promptly clean any and all areas and be responsible for
            any claims, fines or penalties resulting from said access.
