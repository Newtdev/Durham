          In compliance with this Request for Proposals, and subject to all the

          of its officers, directors, or owners of an unincorporated business
          entity has been convicted of any violations of Chapter 78A of the
          General Statutes, the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities

          felony. Furthermore, by executing this proposal, the undersigned
          certifies to the best of Vendor&rsquo;s knowledge and belief, that it

          by G.S. 143-48.5, the undersigned Vendor certifies that it, and each
          of its sub-Contractors for any Contract awarded as a result of this
          RFP, complies with the requirements of Article 2 of Chapter 64 of the

          more than 25 employees in North Carolina to verify the work
          authorization of its employees through the federal E-Verify system.
          &nbsp;G.S. 133-32 and Executive Order 24 (2009) prohibit the offer to,

          of the public Contract of any gift from anyone with a Contract with
          the State, or from any person seeking to do business with the State.
          By execution of this response to the RFP, the undersigned certifies,
          for your entire organization and its employees or agents, that you are
          not aware that any such gift has been offered, accepted, or promised
          by any employees of your organization.
