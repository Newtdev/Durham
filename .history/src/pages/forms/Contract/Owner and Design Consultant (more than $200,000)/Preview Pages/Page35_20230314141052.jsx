              Owner&rsquo;s Sexual Offender Registry Check Certification Form
              (attached as Exhibit F) that the registry checks were conducted on
              each of its contractual personnel providing services or delivering
              goods under this Agreement prior to the commencement of such
              services or the delivery of such goods. &nbsp;The Design
              Consultant shall conduct a current initial check of the registries
              (a check done more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of this
              Agreement shall not satisfy this contractual obligation). &nbsp;In
              addition, the Design Consultant agrees to conduct the registry
              checks and provide a supplemental certification form before any
              additional contractual personnel are used to deliver goods or
              provide services pursuant to this Agreement. &nbsp;The Design
              Consultant further agrees to conduct annual registry checks of all

              services pursuant to this Agreement if said individual appears on
              any of the listed registries. &nbsp;The Design Consultant agrees
              that it will maintain all records and documents necessary to
              demonstrate that it has conducted a thorough check of the
              registries as to each contractual personnel, and agrees to provide
              such records and documents to the Owner upon request. &nbsp;The
              Design Consultant specifically acknowledges that the Owner retains
              the right to audit these records to ensure compliance with this
              section at any time in the Owner&rsquo;s sole discretion.
              &nbsp;Failure to comply with the terms of this provision shall be
              deemed a material breach of the Agreement. &nbsp;In addition, the
              Owner may conduct additional criminal records checks at the
              Owner&rsquo;s expense. &nbsp;If the Owner exercises this right to
              conduct additional criminal records checks, the Design Consultant
              agrees to provide within seven (7) days of request the full name,
              date of birth, state of residency for the past ten years, and any
              additional information requested by the Owner for all contractual
              personnel who may deliver goods or perform services under this

              new contractual personnel who may deliver goods or provide
              services under the Agreement. &nbsp;The Owner reserves the right
              to prohibit any contractual personnel of the Design Consultant
              from delivering goods or providing services under this Agreement
              if the Owner determines, in its sole discretion, that such
              contractual personnel may pose a threat to the safety or
              well-being of students, school personnel or others.
